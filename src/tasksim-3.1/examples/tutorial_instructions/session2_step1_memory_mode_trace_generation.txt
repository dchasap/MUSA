Step 1: Generate Memory trace
-----------------------------

In order to generate a memory mode trace we use the script
job_tracer_memory.bash.
If we open it we can observed that it contains:

 - SLURM directives.
 - MUSA configuration options:
 - APPNAME: application binary name
 - ARGS: application arguments
 - RANKS: number of MPI ranks
 - MEMORY_MODE: boolean value that determines if the trace is in burst or memory modes
   - Memory mode variables (which we can ignore at the moment): 
     - TSMPI_MEM_PHASES_INIT: first OpenMP/OmpSs phase that will be traced in memory mode.
     - TSMPI_MEM_PHASES_NUM: number of OpenMP/OmpSs phases that will be traced in memory mode.
     - TSMPI_RANK_INIT: first MPI rank from which to stract memory mode information.
     - TSMPI_RANK_NUM: number of ranks from which to stract memory mode information.
 - TSMPI_SIM_CONFIG: TaskSim's simulator hardware configuration 
 - TSMPI_SIM_CORES: list with the number of cores per MPI rank to simulate.

The values are already the ones we need for the tutorial. To launch it on
MareNostrum4 run:

$> sbatch job_tracer_memory.bash

After some time executing the job (~20 minutes) the job should finish,
and the error log should only contain output from the module load events.

(Remember that you can check the job status with squeue).

The trace that has now been generated contains the same information
that the burst trace contained, plus the list of executed instructions and
the memory addresses accessed, separated by WorkDescriptor/Task (OmpSs
nomenclature) for the selected mpi_phases.

  - Contained on TRACE_sp-mz.A.4_000004_MEMO/TRACE/trace_ts/
    Memory addresses are the .mem. files and basic blocs execxuted on the
    .bbl. and .dict. files.

Also it contains all the information we had on the Burst mode trace:

 + In TRACE_sp-mz.A.4_000004_MEMO/LOGS/ there are logs for each step taken
   during the trace generation.
 + In TRACE_sp-mz.A.4_000004_MEMO/TRACE/trace_prv there is a Paraver trace.
   It contains information about the behavior of the application during a
   native run. It can be visualized with Paraver.
 + TRACE_sp-mz.A.4_000004_MEMO/LOGS/ now contains an extra set of logs
   for the tracing of instructions an memory addresses.
 + In TRACE_sp-mz.A.4_000004_MEMO/SIMULATION/A1_PRESIM we will find the
   scripts necessary to execute the simulations.
 + Inside said folder we will find a set of configuration files, extended
   from marenostrum_configuration.conf which was copied on the root directory.
   These different versions have a different number of cores per MPI_rank and
   different simulation modes (MEMORY or BURST_ONLY). These will be used as
   configuration files for TaskSim to run the single rank simulation of the
   mpi_phases.
