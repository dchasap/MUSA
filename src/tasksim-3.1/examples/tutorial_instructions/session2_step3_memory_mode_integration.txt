Session 2; Memory mode simulation

Step 3: Memory simulations result extrapolation and integration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before being able to merge the different parts of the simulation, we must
calculate two correction factors.
 - Memory/Burst correction factor: as the mpi_phases simulated on burst mode
   will use the real time duration of the host system, which may differ from
   the one specified in the memory mode configuration. This is done in one
   core per MPI rank simulation and used in all of them.
 - Memory contention correction factor. As we can simulate the speed
   difference caused by the memory subsuystem (differences in Cache locality,
   contention, etc), we calculate a correction factor to apply to the
   simulations generated in Burst mode.

$> ./extrapolate_burst_duration.bash

This will have created a separate set of .dat files with the sufix _FINAL.
These will be the set of results that we will integrate for our final
integration.

If at any point in the simulations with TaskSim there is an error and
the simulations have to be relaunched, we must execute the cleanup script.
This script will remove all partial results and scripts generated by
generate_musa_presim.bash. Then we can regenerate the simulations again.

(ONLY ON ERROR) $> ./cleanup.bash

The integration step will be performed on:
 + TRACE_sp-mz.A.4_000004_MEMO/SIMULATION/A2_INTEGRATION.
In this folder there is a set of scripts and configuration files to execute Dimemas
with the appropiate configuration. To integrate all traces, we execute:

$> ./integrate_dimemas_simulations.bash

This last integration step will generate one Paraver trace for each selected
configuration (in this example 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 cores per MPI rank).
