================== Step 5: Burst mode simulation ==============================

Once we have the burst mode trace. We can start the simulations.
For this we should go to the presimulation folder:

$> cd TRACE_sp-mz.A.4_000004_BRST/SIMULATION/A1_PRESIM

This folder will contain a set of scripts to generate the different
simulation commands, and the set of configuration files to run those
simulations. This configuration files have been modified with the
different number of cores from the one we had on the our initial directory.

In order to generate all the simulation caommands we must execute:

$> ./generate_musa_presim.bash

This command reads the burst mode trace and for each section between MPI events
it generates a command to simulate said region with TaskSim. It will generate
one simulation command per rank and number of cores per MPI rank.

The number of simulations will end reaching 10.000, so it is better to run them
throught greasy.

Greasy is a utility that reads a file and runs each line as a separate command.
It manages all cores in a node in order to run them in parallel, making
the simulation process much easier. It also provides restart files in case of
error, which we should not need for this tutorial.

This command generates one folder per configuration file in which the
simulation will be run and the results stored. It generates an greasy file for
each of the configurations and finally, a global greasy file to run
all simulations.

For this turorial we will run this last file with all simulation commands as
they are short enough.

To launch the simulation to MareNostrum4:

$> sbatch launch_all_musa_presims.bash

This simulations will take around 3 minutes.
