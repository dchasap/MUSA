================== Step 3: Native run =========================================

In order to have some data to compare against, first we must run the
benchmark natively on MareNostrum 4.To do so we have prepared a script:
native_run.bash. This script will run sp-mz with 4 MPI ranks and a different
number of cores per MPI rank. This will be done with the Nanos++ flag
"--smp-workers".

To send the job:

$> sbatch native_run.bash

This native executions should only take a couple of minutes, and the results
will be stored in the native_logs/ directory.

Once the native edxecutions have finished, we can generate the speed-up graph
with the generate_speedup_graph.bash script:

$> ./generate_speedup_graph.bash

This will gather the execution times from the logs (and later the simulation
execution times). Thus giving us a baseline to compare our simulations
against.
